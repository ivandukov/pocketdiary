Due to the Corona crisis, you are at home most of the time and run the risk of losing the feeling of everyday life.This open source app is intended to provide an overview of one‘s own daily activities and associated feelings.
In contrast to other apps that follow a similar approach, our app introduces so-called „achievements“, which should motivate the user to deal with themselves on an emotional level.
The app should help you get to know yourself better, Enable daily self-reflection and preserve memories by being asked every day what you did today and how you feel.
